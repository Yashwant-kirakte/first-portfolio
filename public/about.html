<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

Hi, Iâ€™m Yashwant ðŸ‘‹
<br>
<p>
Iâ€™m 17 years old and currently focused on building a strong foundation in computer science and technology. With a keen interest in CSE, AIML, and IT, Iâ€™m exploring opportunities to grow academically and practically, while also preparing for competitive exams like MHT CET and future challenges like GATE.</p>

<p>Beyond studies, Iâ€™m passionate about fitness and self-improvementâ€”working on building a healthy, muscular body and developing the discipline that comes with it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m curious by nature and enjoy learning new things, whether itâ€™s programming languages like Python, problem-solving through DSA, or understanding how technologies like AI shape the world around us.</p>

<p>I believe in continuous growth, balancing knowledge, skills, and health to create a strong base for the future.</p>
